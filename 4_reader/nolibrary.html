    <div>1. Everything Is Not On the Internet The Internet consists of a small percentage of what’s published. Search engines such as Google, AltaVista, FireFox and Yahoo access are limited. ALA reports that only 8% of all journals and even fewer books are on the Internet.  The most reliable scholarly information is available in books and journals.  Preliminary steps to find the appropriate search terms should start with print indexes and subject headings volumes.  </div>
    <div>2. The Internet Is Not Organized There is not a system that catalogs and organizes all resources on the Internet.   A search on the Internet is similar to searching an unclassified catalog.  When you use any of the search engines, you’re searching only part of the Internet.  Searches are not always relevant to your topic and can cause a lot of wasted time, frustration and confusion</div>
    <div>3. The Internet Doesn’t Have Quality Control - Quality control isn’t easy to achieve on the Internet.  Open Source information on the Internet is quite common and easy to get misinformed information.  Anyone with access to the Internet can publish a Website.</div>
    <div>4. Sources on the Internet are Harder to Identify - Information on the Internet is hard to tell who’s telling you what and where is the location of the information. When you use information in your paper from the Internet, it’s important to print it out and cite your sources.   Information taken from the Web can change overnight.  Information taken from the library or databases in the library gives the exact location.  One must give full documentation when using information from a site. See the Academic Integrity Statement under Academic and Classroom Conduct for Tennessee State University’s response to plagiarism and academic dishonesty.</div>
    <div>5. Library Online Resources are Available 24/7 - Online databases can be accessed 24 hours a day 7 days a week from the library’s webpage. These databases are in the library’s collection and can be accessed on campus and remotely with your University ID via the Internet. This is not to be confused with searching the Internet.</div>
    <div>6. Tuition and Fees Pay for Library Use - Library resources are paid for with your tuition and fees, so take advantage of it.  Libraries provide free access to scholarly books, journals, newspapers, encyclopedias, and other print reference sources.  A lot of information on the Internet is FREE, except scholarly materials.  A paid subscription is required to access.</div>
    <div>7. Trained  Professionals Available For Assistance - Knowledgeable and friendly librarians are available to assist with locating information in person, chat, e-mail or telephone. Request assistance at the beginning of your research and spare valuable time spent on the Internet.</div>
    <div>8. E-books are Available - E-books are full-text and searchable. All E-book collections have records on the online catalog and can be accessed individually by title or in collections in collections like PsycBooks, Credo, Safari, Books 24x7,or EBSCO’s E-Book Collection. </div>
    <div>9. The Internet Has Fewer Archival Materials - The library has older materials than the Internet. Digitalization that goes back more than 10-15 years can be difficult to locate on the Internet. The Internet provides more timely information, and is constantly updated.</div>
    <div>10. Does Library-less Universities Work - A virtual librarycannot replace the traditional library. To California libraries (Monterey and California Polytechnic University) attempted this method, only to find out first hand that it can’t work. They found out that everything is not on the Internet.
