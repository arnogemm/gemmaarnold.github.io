    <div class="row numberone" id="theone">
      <div class="column one"><h1>Everything Is Not On The Internet</h1></div>
      <div class="column two"><p class="para">The Internet consists of a small percentage of what’s published. Search engines such as Google, AltaVista, FireFox and Yahoo access are limited. ALA reports that only 8% of all journals and even fewer books are on the Internet.  The most reliable scholarly information is available in books and journals.  Preliminary steps to find the appropriate search terms should start with print indexes and subject headings volumes.</p></div>
      <div class="three"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="row numbertwo" id="ntwo">
      <div class="column one"><h1>The Internet Is Not Organized</h1></div>
      <div class="column two"><p class="para">There is not a system that catalogs and organizes all resources on the Internet.   A search on the Internet is similar to searching an unclassified catalog.  When you use any of the search engines, you’re searching only part of the Internet.  Searches are not always relevant to your topic and can cause a lot of wasted time, frustration and confusion.</p></div>
      <div class="three"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="row numberthree" id="nthree">
      <div class="column one"><h1>The Internet Doesn’t Have Quality Control</h1></div>
      <div class="column two"><p class="para">Quality control isn’t easy to achieve on the Internet.  Open Source information on the Internet is quite common and easy to get misinformed information.  Anyone with access to the Internet can publish a Website.</p></div>
      <div class="three"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row numberfour" id="nfour">
      <div class="column one"><h1>Sources on the Internet are Harder to Identify</h1></div>
      <div class="column two"><p class="para">Information on the Internet is hard to tell who’s telling you what and where is the location of the information. When you use information in your paper from the Internet, it’s important to print it out and cite your sources.   Information taken from the Web can change overnight.  Information taken from the library or databases in the library gives the exact location.  One must give full documentation when using information from a site. See the Academic Integrity Statement under Academic and Classroom Conduct for Tennessee State University’s response to plagiarism and academic dishonesty.</p></div>
      <div class="three"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row numberfive" id="nfive">
      <div class="column one"><h1>Library Online Resources are Available 24/7</h1></div>
      <div class="column two"><p class="para">Online databases can be accessed 24 hours a day 7 days a week from the library’s webpage. These databases are in the library’s collection and can be accessed on campus and remotely with your University ID via the Internet. This is not to be confused with searching the Internet.</p></div>
      <div class="three"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row numbersix" id="nsix">
      <div class="column one"><h1>Tuition and Fees Pay for Library Use</h1></div>
      <div class="column two"><p class="para">Library resources are paid for with your tuition and fees, so take advantage of it.  Libraries provide free access to scholarly books, journals, newspapers, encyclopedias, and other print reference sources.  A lot of information on the Internet is FREE, except scholarly materials.  A paid subscription is required to access.</p></div>
      <div class="three"></div>

    <div class="row numberseven" id="nseven">
      <div class="column one"><h1>Trained  Professionals Available For Assistance</h1></div>
      <div class="column two"><p class="para">Knowledgeable and friendly librarians are available to assist with locating information in person, chat, e-mail or telephone. Request assistance at the beginning of your research and spare valuable time spent on the Internet.</p></div>
      <div class="three"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row numbereight" id="neight">
      <div class="column one"><h1>E-books are Available</h1></div>
      <div class="column two"><p class="para">E-books are full-text and searchable. All E-book collections have records on the online catalog and can be accessed individually by title or in collections in collections like PsycBooks, Credo, Safari, Books 24x7,or EBSCO’s E-Book Collection.</p></div>
      <div class="three"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row numbernine" id="nnine">
      <div class="column one"><h1>The Internet Has Fewer Archival Materials</h1></div>
      <div class="column two"><p class="para">The library has older materials than the Internet. Digitalization that goes back more than 10-15 years can be difficult to locate on the Internet. The Internet provides more timely information, and is constantly updated.</p></div>
      <div class="three"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row numberten" id="nten">
      <div class="three"></div>
      <div class="column one"><h1>Does Library-less Universities Work?</h1></div>
      <div class="column two"><p class="para">A virtual library cannot replace the traditional library. To California libraries (Monterey and California Polytechnic University) attempted this method, only to find out first hand that it can’t work. They found out that everything is not on the Internet.</p></div>
