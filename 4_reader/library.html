        <div class="text">Croneberger testified that some libraries have created a separate type of library card for juveniles, but that most have not. Within days after his testimony in court, I spotted the following in The Brooklyn Heights Paper, my community newspaper:

              "After months of wrangling, the Brooklyn Public Library has finally decided to give an inch in the debate over whether minors should be allowed access to R-rated videos.</div>

        <div class="text">The contrast to the CDA is interesting. Nobody is burning any books, or even removing them from the library shelves. Instead, the library will continue to contain every conceivable kind of information, including works on sex. Some libraries--like the Brooklyn Public library--will simply not let children with the juvenile card take these works out. Most libraries, as Croneberger testified, will let children look at anything, once their parents have decided to allow them to have a library card.</div>

        <div class="text">The CDA is a book-burning law. The prison terms and fines it provides for are very specific, while its defenses--that an information provider tried to use "reasonable and effective" means to prevent children from accessing the material--are very vague. This means that a provider feeling the chilling effect of the law is much safer deleting information from the Internet (the equivalent of burning a book) than relying on a vague defense.</div>

        <div class="text">Nevertheless, CDA proponents point to the "reasonable and effective" measures defense as proof that the CDA, like the Brooklyn Public Library's new rule, merely governs who can receive material, but does not lead to its destruction. However, all prior indecency laws are extremely specific about their "safe harbors". Television and radio can safely broadcast indecent material after ten p.m. 900 line providers need not fear prosecution so long as they take a credit card from the caller. By contrast, nothing in the CDA spells out what an online information provider can do to avoid getting in trouble.</div>

Even as they argue to the Philadelphia court that the vague safe harbor makes the CDA a "narrowly tailored" law, and therefore constitutional, they have been loud and insistent that no form of regulation short of electronic "book-burning" will protect minors.</div>

        <div class="text">A: No. To date, only a few software programs have been released to regulate children's access to pornography, such as SurfWatch and NetNanny. Also, these programs can be bypassed by users with a good knowledge of the Internet and some technical sophistication. Even if better technical solutions become available, this approach is inadequate in and of itself because: children can walk down the street to another computer; parents' technical ability often pales in comparison to their children's expertise; pornographers aren't legally discouraged from peddling their materials to children.
