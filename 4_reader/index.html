        0: I’ve recently been thinking about libraries, and I know this is a
        conversation we’ve shared off and on for a while. Perhaps I’ll pick it
        back up, now. The first libraries were based on an Archive model, a safe
        place for important records. They housed mostly commercial transactions
        and inventories recorded on clay tablets. As the library developed, it
        retained this archival function, but on July 1, 1731, Benjamin Franklin
        and the Leather Apron Club of Philadelphia established the first public
        Circulating Library. Books were quite expensive at the time and by
        pooling resources, many volumes could be shared among contributing
        members. One was free to borrow any book for a length of time, return
        it, and borrow another. This new library was built to expand and evolve,
        a shifting arrangement of ideas and objects constantly circulating in a
        concentrated community of committed readers. In recent years, yet
        another library model has materialized, specifically online, which might be
        called the Distributing Library. The Internet Archive or The Gutenberg
        Project are perhaps examples, where a large collection of documents are
        collected together electronically and made available free for download.
        Instead of 50,000 books, one copy each, sealed in an Archive; or 15,000
        books, a few copies each, all constantly circulating; the Distributing Library
        offers any number of “books,” with unlimited copies, all available free to
        be downloaded, digested, dispersed. Now, if the Archive Model essentially
        treats books as capital, investing them back into the institution in order to
        reinforce and expand the reach of the library, and the Circulating Library
        constitutes a gift economy by freely sharing the books in its collection
        through a network of benign strangers, then what economic model
        corresponds to the Distributing Library?
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-two">
        1: Libraries started out as a single building whose assets were the
        property of the sovereign or state. Through the work of Franklin and
        others, libraries evolved into a set of branches whose assets were the
        property of a membership, township, or community. The Archive is
        one place. The branch system is many places. When you examine this progression, the makeup (or perhaps the markup) of the Distributing
        Library becomes clearer. It has a slippery relationship to place because it
        is housed on an infinite number of servers and accessed though an infinite
        number of web browsers. It also has a slippery relationship to its own
        assets. The library’s assets are not there to be merely stored or loaned.
        The Distributing Library’s assets are there, really, to be copied.

        In the days of the Archive, there were few copies and few originals. Taxes
        may have helped to fund the library, but fundamentally it was controlled
        by the state and therefore all information was controlled by the state
        as well. The structure was so centralized that it was a gift economy’s
        virtual opposite. Writing in The Gift, Lewis Hyde gives the case of Enrico
        Malatesta, head of an anarchist gang who hid out in the woods near Naples
        trying to unravel the state one archive at a time. Here’s Hyde quoting
        historian James Joll: “At the village of Lentino the column arrived on a
        Sunday morning, declared King Victor Emanuel deposed and carried out
        the anarchist ritual of burning the archives which contained the record
        of property holdings, debts, and taxes.” The uprising happened in 1877,
        nearly 150 years after Franklin’s revolutionary new Circulating Library
        model was functioning in America. It is as if Malatesta had realized that
        the state was relying on an outmoded library technology, the Archive, to
        exert control. At the same time, the increasing circulation of books from
        Gutenberg onward had created a more literate citizenry and therefore
        a more informed (and demanding) public. Information wanted to be free,
        open, and available to everyone, as Franklin’s library was.

        The Leather Apron Club was also known as the Junto, a word Franklin
        adapted from the Spanish verb “to join.” Sharing books empowered
        these mostly middle-class, highly-literate merchants. Sharing also eroded
        some of the hierarchy the Archive created between civilians and the
        state. Finally, sharing books established what Hyde calls a “feeling bond”
        among members of Franklin’s circle, a sense of union. E pluribus unum.
        The Junto’s roots were not in book collecting but in discussion. It was a
        social club before it was a library. This is telling. In the days of the Archive,
        items existed to be looked up one-by-one on your own. With the advent
        of the Circulating Library, items existed to be discussed by a group.
        Now with the Distributing Library, a further change is taking place. Let’s
        tune our radios back to December 2008 and listen to Lawrence Lessig speaking to Terry Gross on NPR:
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-two bold">
        Copyright law was architected for a world where copies were the
        exception. [...] In the digital age, every single thing we do with creative
        work on a digital network produces a copy, so that the act of reading on
        a digital network produces a copy. The act of sharing my book with my
        mother produces a copy. Any of these activities which in real space don’t
        produce a copy, in cyberspace produce a copy.
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-two">
        The Circulating Library model was not a digital model, it was a real-world
        model. In the real world, you have to surrender ownership to increase
        access. In the digital world, you don’t. In the real world, information
        content (a text) is wedded to a physical form (a book). In the digital world,
        information content (a text) exists as one layer separable from digital
        form (a PDF, email, blog post, text-to-speech reading, etc).Thus while
        Franklin’s club had shifted the emphasis on how books were used from
        owned objects of study to shared objects for conversation, the Distributing
        Library continues and deepens that idea of culture as conversation.
        Even if you wanted to burn the library down now, you couldn’t: its users
        have made a thousand copies of it, ready to take the place of the original.
        Few of those users feel that what they’ve done is wrong: they want to
        do whatever they want with the content they’ve accessed. Therefore,
        it’s time for the state to play catch up, and that’s why there’s so much
        upheaval in copyright law, in newspaper publishing, in the distribution of
        music, and so much more. We are experiencing a massive shift from the
        Library of Alexandria to Google Books. They may be comparable, but
        they’re not the same. Does that answer your question?
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-one">
        0: Yes, in part. But, frankly I’m surprised at your naive distinction between
        the “real” and the “digital” worlds. Does the computer and its contents
        no longer belong to the same world that we live in? Digital information
        may appear disembodied, but it is always nothing more than a collection of
        simple electric charges, on or off, 1 or 0. And, if you don’t believe me, try
        grabbing your plugged-in Macbook by the motherboard, and you’re in for
        a jolt of reality.
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-two">
        1: Maybe the distinction isn’t between “real” or “virtual,” maybe it’s
        simply between “analog” or “digital.” Circulating and Distributing libraries provide two different platforms with some different possibilities. But
        when you’re trying to optimize how the information is used, it’s possible
        to be platform independent. Information wants to be free, accessible to
        whomever, wherever, however.
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-one">
        0: “Information wants to be free”? Does it really? The second half of
        Stewart Brand’s aphorism is often conveniently omitted, so I’ll include it
        here for you:
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-one bold">
        Information Wants To Be Free. Information also wants to be expensive.
        Information wants to be free because it has become so cheap to distribute,
        copy, and recombine—too cheap to meter. It wants to be expensive
        because it can be immeasurably valuable to the recipient. That tension will
        not go away. It leads to endless wrenching debate about price, copyright,
        “intellectual property,” the moral rightness of casual distribution, because
        each round of new devices makes the tension worse, not better.
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-two">
        1: But Brand’s aphorism makes a cost distinction. I’m making a use
        distinction. They’re quite different. Maybe we should rewrite him:
        “Information wants to be freed.”
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-one">
        0: Nice one. But still, the tired rhetoric of “free information” has its
        roots in the mid-20th century discourse of Norbert Weiner’s Cybernetics
        and Claude Shannon’s Information Theory, which model a communications
        system that isolates information from its carrier. Technically, this may
        be correct—and yet, I challenge you to find me some information that
        arrives without a vehicle ... Perhaps this is why our conversation here,
        now, makes some sense in a bulletin about books. Books are a particularly
        robust vehicle for delivering information, and I think you’ll agree that
        the form of the book is as important as the information it carries for the
        total message delivered.

        And I’d go further. I’m really not happy at all with the idea that information
        wants to be free—I think it probably wants a house, a body,
        a vehicle. And, it wants that carrier to be as carefully considered as
        what it’s carrying. (The message + the form = the contents of the
        communication.) I suppose I agree that the information can be separated
        from its carrier and can be recombined in new objects for circulation

        and conversation as you describe. I only think, practically speaking, that
        information never exists free-floating, it is always made physical by way
        of its medium. There is no such thing as pure information.
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-two">
        1: I can see your point. Maybe here’s where we begin to see a boundary
        between *what libraries want* and *what books want.* Libraries want
        the information first and foremost and are more agnostic about the carrier
        of that information. They spread “Lux et Veritas”—light and truth. That
        is their public trust. Franklin’s library grew out of his Enlightenment ideals,
        and the idea of the Enlightenment itself is embedded with this idea that
        “knowledge” is analogous to “light.” It is disembodied, diffuse, and not
        naturally controlled. Harvard University Library Director Robert Darnton
        draws a useful parallel between the two in an essay called “Google & the
        Future of Books” for the 12 Feb 2009 issue of The New York Review
        of Books. He writes:
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-two bold">
        [Most] of us would subscribe to the principles inscribed in prominent places
        in our public libraries. “Free To All,” it says above the main entrance to
        the Boston Public Library; and in the words of Thomas Jefferson, carved
        in gold letters on the wall of the Trustees’ Room of the New York Public
        Library: “I look to the diffusion of light and education as the resource most
        to be relied on for ameliorating the condition promoting the virtue and
        advancing the happiness of man.” We are back with the Enlightenment.
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-two">
        But what I think you’re saying is that books want to remain as book-like
        as possible, while other information carriers—webpages, for example—
        try to take their place. We dislike calling Amazon’s Kindle a “book.” It’s
        really something that’s emulative of a book. You “turn” a digital “page”
        by pressing a button, which wipes the screen of pixels and replaces those
        pixels with new ones. Design is the set of decisions that add one metaphor
        on top of another to make the Kindle feel book-like. It’s an exercise in
        analogy. But books don’t want the Kindle. Books, as a medium, want
        more books. Information, however, just wants to be transmitted, through
        whatever host allows it to spread as widely as possible. It’s a bit Darwinist,
        I suppose. (Richard Dawkins would be so pleased.)

        The whole debate reminds me a bit of a similar one that was raging
        in the 1960s over records versus live music. There’s a famous radio documentary and article by Glenn Gould about it—have you ever read
        it?—it’s called “The Prospects of Recording.” There’s a great moment
        where Gould relates the protests of live concert musicians to the protests
        of the typesetters’ union:
      </div>

    <div class="text-scroll c-two bold">
      Automation: a crusade which musicians’ union leaders currently share
      with typesetters and which they affirm with the fine disdain of featherbedding
      firemen for the diesel locomotive. In the midst of a proliferation
      of recorded sound which virtually erases earlier listening patterns,
      the American Federation of Musicians promotes that challenging motto
      “LIVE MUSIC IS BEST.”
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-two">
        Gould dismisses these concerns as an anachronism, referring to the
        Presidential election of more than 20 years ago. “A judgment with the
        validity of a ‘Win with Wilkie’ sticker on the windshield of a well-preserved
        ’39 LaSalle.”

      <div class="text-scroll c-three">
        0: You mentioned typesetters. While preparing the second edition of The
        Art of Computer Programming in the early 1980s, Donald Knuth received
        the galley proofs and was quite upset by what he saw. His publisher had
        just switched to a digital typesetting system and the typographic quality
        of this edition was far below the first. Knuth realized that typesetting
        only meant arranging 0’s and 1’s (ink and no ink) in the proper pattern,
        and figured, as a computer programmer, he could do something about it.
        He spent the next ten years developing TeX as a language for writers to
        directly produce high-quality typesetting. As opposed to industry-standard
        page layout programs that implement a “What You See Is What You
        Get” (WYSIWYG) paradigm, TeX produces “What You See Is What
        You Mean” (WYSIWYM) by using plain text files and a semantic mark-up
        language compiled on-the-fly to produce final pages.
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-four">
        1: Run that by me again.
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-three">
        0: Generally speaking, since the invention of movable type, the typesetting
        of a book’s pages has followed the same model—“What You
        See Is What You Get.” Typographic technologies have changed at a
        constantly accelerating pace from steel punch-cuts to Monotype’s leadslugs
        to phototypesetting’s chemical emulsions and finally to the exclusively
        digital production of typeset pages. Each one of these relies on a human
        operator, or typesetter, to translate the texts into typographic form
        and compose the page. As the typesetter works, he sees the full page
        compositely formed before his eyes. Whether assembling metal letters
        in-between rows of leading (while reading backwards) or preparing long
        typographic galleys on Linotronic paper, the typesetter sees what he
        is making as he is making it. Even in a digital software program such
        as Adobe InDesign, the operator is given a full-page interface where typesetting
        choices are reflected back in real time. What You See Is What
        You Get. But, with the appearance of the computer, Knuth realized,
        another possibility had arrived. (This may be what you were getting at a while back when you suggested that “Information wants to be freed ...”)
        Computer software can be delegated the technical work of assembling
        lines of letters comfortably on a page. And this kind of brute-force
        automation and progressive problem solving is likely the work for which
        the digital computer is best-suited. So, if software can automatically
        perform the rote tasks of typesetting, that leaves the writer (who has also
        been electronically enfranchised as producer) free to make page layouts
        by simply instructing the computer as to what she means. The writer
        prepares a text that says what it says, but also includes the structural
        relationships between the parts of the text. “This is a headline.” Or
        “The next paragraph is a quotation.” When this kind of text-as-structure
        is passed to an automated typesetting system, the result is What You
        See Is What You Mean. This is where the moral objection comes in.
        Once the typographic decisions have been passed over to software, then
        the information no longer is tied to any one specific form. The possibilities
        multiply. It can find any of many forms from electronic text message to
        glossy magazine to Portable Document Format. The transitions are
        increasingly fluid, increasingly automatic. But instead of prying itself from
        its carrier, the information becomes, paradoxically, more specifically bound
        to its medium. The communication is always a combination of what is being
        said and how what is being said is being delivered. The medium remains
        the message, and ever-increasingly so.
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-four">
        1: Ultimately, you’re right, not just about books, but about the medium
        of language itself. Let me try to respond by splicing several different
        speakers from several different sources. The first is MIT Media Lab
        founder Nicholas Negroponte, who wrote a column for Wired in 1996
        about his newly released book Being Digital:
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-four bold">
        What weighs less than one millionth of an ounce, consumes less than a
        millionth of a cubic inch, holds 4 million bits, and costs less than US$2?
        What weighs more than 1 pound, is larger than 50 cubic inches, contains
        less than 4 million bits, and costs more than $20? The same thing:
        Being DigitaL stored on an integrated circuit and Being Digital
        published as a hardcover book. [...] We seldom carve words in rocks
        these days, we will probably not print many of them on paper for binding
        tomorrow. In fact, the cost of paper (which has risen 50 percent in the
        past year), the amount of human energy required to move it, and the volume of space needed to store it make books as we know them less
        than the optimum method for delivering bits. In fact, the art of bookmaking
        is not only less than perfect but will probably be as relevant in 2020 as
        blacksmithing is today.
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-four">
        Paul Conway, the former head of Yale University Library’s Preservation
        Department, might draw a different conclusion. In an essay also from 1996
        titled “Preservation in the Digital World,” Conway writes:
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-four bold">
        Our capacity to record information has increased exponentially over
        time while the longevity of the media used to store the information has
        decreased equivalently. [...] In order to achieve the kind of information
        density that is common today, we must depend on machines that rapidly
        reach obsolescence to create information and then make it readable
        and intelligible.
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-four">
        Conway compares modern information technology to the book publishing
        boom of the 1850s when more books than ever were being printed
        smaller, cheaper, and faster. While “illuminated manuscripts and other
        documents from Medieval times are quite able to withstand centuries
        more study and admiration,” Conway notes, “Herman Melville’s Moby
        Dick, or The Whale, first published in 1851 on typically acidic paper,
        symbolizes the worldwide preservation challenges of all 19th- and 20thcentury
        publishing.” In cases like Moby Dick, the medium, literally, was
        disintegrating, and taking the message with it.

        Acid-free paper wasn’t developed until the 1950s and is often symbolized
        today with a ringed infinity symbol appearing on the book’s copyright
        page. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, a different kind of
        deconstruction was challenging the book’s material (if not physical) form.
        Derrida opens his 1972 book Dissemination with an “Outwork,” a text
        that, as he explains, exists externally to the book itself.
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-four bold">
        This (therefore) will not have been a book. [...] I will not feign, according
        to the code, either premeditation or improvisation. These texts are assembled
        otherwise; it is not my intention here to present them. The question
        here, precisely, is that of presentation. [...] [The] book form alone can
        no longer settle—here for example—the case of those writing processes which, in practically questioning the form, must also dismantle it.
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-four">
        While the book form, right down to its now acid-free paper, seeks to
        preserve and extend, Derrida seeks to dislocate and upend all the knowledge
        structures represented by the book and even the tool of writing
        itself in search of new ones. Later in the book, he retells the story from
        Plato’s Phaedrus of the “old god” Theuth, who presented the King of
        Egypt with the gift of writing:
      </div>

      <div class="text-scroll c-four bold">
        When it came to writing, Theuth said, “This discipline, my King, will make
        the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories: my invention is a
        recipe (pharmakon) for both memory and wisdom.” But the King said,
        “Theuth, my master of arts, to one man it is given to create the elements
        of an art, to another to judge the extent of harm and usefulness it will have
        for those who are going to employ it. And now, since you are father of
        written letters, your paternal goodwill has led you to pronounce the very
        opposite of what is their real power. The fact is that this invention will
        produce forgetfulness in the souls of those who have learned it. They will
        not need to exercise their memories, being able to rely on what is written,
        calling things to mind no longer from within themselves by their own
        unaided powers, but under the stimulus of external marks that are alien to
        themselves. So it’s not a recipe for memory, but for reminding, that you
        have discovered.”

        Earlier we described information and knowledge as a kind of disembodied
        “light,” but Derrida points out that accessing that light requires Theuth’s
        “recipe” of writing and that this recipe is some kind of a drug—both
        remedy and poison. Perhaps it is true that we make books in order to
        forget. Negroponte says that by making more things, smaller, cheaper,
        faster, and more widely accessible, we’ll get smarter. Conway warns that
        it was precisely making objects in this way that led to widespread rot and
        decay. Derrida shows that even without rot and decay a book’s material
        form might need to be dismantled. Plato reminds us that the very tool
        used to create books—writing—may have placed us in this double bind
        for good, between remembering and forgetting, information on or off,
        from zero to one and back.
